      <li>
        Took a career break due to
        <b>H4 dependent visa work limitations</b> while relocating to the USA
        with my husband.
      </li>
      <li>
        Focused on <b>family priorities</b> and embraced motherhood which
        brought immense joy and responsibilities and taught me valuable skills
        like
        <b>patience, prioritization and resilience.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        Followed my passion for creativity by
        <b>launching and managing my YouTube channel- Rinku HandCrafts</b> where
        I created and shared basic to advanced Crochet tutorials and DIY Craft
        videos honing skills like video editing and content creation. Learned
        many tools and apps like Canva, YT Studio, Viva Video etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gained experience in managing an
        <b>online presence and building a creative community</b> where I led a
        <b>community of 200+ creators</b> providing guidance on audience
        engagement and content growth.

      <li>
        Continued <b>self-learning with various online trainings</b> and pursued

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        This time off allowed me to develop personally and professionally, as it
        strengthened my
        <b
          >adaptability, problem-solving, multitasking, time-management and
          organizational skills.</b
        >
      </li>
